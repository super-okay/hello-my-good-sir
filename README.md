# Hello My Good Sir !

If somebody mentions me on Twitter, this bot will automatically respond with "Hello my good sir !".

## Filtered Stream
This bot uses the Twitter API's filtered stream function to listen for posts that contain my Twitter handle @_superokay. When a post is found, it will then respond to that post using the Tweepy Python library.
